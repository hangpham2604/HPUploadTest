This is a test file for file upload testing.

This case study will test your knowledge and level of comfort in testing. It would
take around 3-5 hours to complete it; however, you can submit it within 3 days.
As involved in a new project, you will be working on automating the regression
tests on upload features from scratch. Please propose:
● A test plan which can help deliver the product with the highest quality.
● The architecture of the test framework.
● Developing automated tests for upload features.
Website to be tested: https://demo.guru99.com/test/upload/
Notes: It would be highly recommended to have your answers in BDD syntax. The
project should be implemented as a test framework. Development roadmap for the
test framework is a plus.
Reminder:
The candidate should put the code into a new public github repo. Instructions of
how to set up and run the test should be given in a README document.
Once you have completed the case study, please email it back to Candy at

Thank You and Good Luck
